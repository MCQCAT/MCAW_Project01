    <h2>Coronary MCQS</h2>
    <p>
      It started as a small initiative in the summer semester of 2023, created
      by a first-year medical student on
      <a href="https://t.me/coronarymcq" target="_blank"

      >
      . What began as a simple platform for sharing and solving questions among
      classmates quickly developed into a valuable resource for hundreds of
      students. This initiative has grown thanks to the active participation of
      many others, who contribute by writing questions and ensuring our content
      stays diverse and relevant.

      As we continue to expand, Coronary MCQS remains committed to delivering
      high-level, reliable multiple-choice questions tailored specifically for
      medical students. Our focus is shifting towards creating even more
      specialized content, especially for the clinical years, where the need for
      practical, scenario-based learning is crucial. With contributions from
      students, we ensure that our questions reflect real-world medical cases,
      helping students stay prepared for the challenges ahead. We're excited to
      keep growing and providing valuable resources for years to come.
